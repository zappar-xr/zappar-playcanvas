calculated every frame, and you can only read it. If it's ASPECT_MANUAL, you can set
the value.
 * @property aspectRatioMode - The aspect ratio mode of the camera. Can be:

* {@link ASPECT_AUTO}: aspect ratio will be calculated from the current render
target's width divided by height.
* {@link ASPECT_MANUAL}: use the aspectRatio value.

{@link PROJECTION_PERSPECTIVE} cameras only. Defaults to 45.
 * @property horizontalFov - Set which axis to use for the Field of View
calculation. Defaults to false.
 * @property nearClip - The distance from the camera before which no rendering
will take place. Defaults to 0.1.
 * @property orthoHeight - The half-height of the orthographic view window (in
the Y-axis). Used for {@link PROJECTION_ORTHOGRAPHIC} cameras only. Defaults to 10.
 * @property priority - Controls the order in which cameras are rendered. Cameras
with smaller values for priority are rendered first. Defaults to 0.
 * @property renderTarget - Render target to which rendering of the cameras
is performed. If not set, it will render simply to the screen.
 * @property rect - Controls where on the screen the camera will be rendered in
normalized screen coordinates. Defaults to [0, 0, 1, 1].
 * @property scissorRect - Clips all pixels which are not in the rectangle.
The order of the values is [x, y, width, height]. Defaults to [0, 0, 1, 1].
 * @property postEffects - The post effects queue for this camera.
Use this to add or remove post effects from the camera.
 * @property frustumCulling - Controls the culling of mesh instances against
the camera frustum, i.e. if objects outside of camera should be omitted from rendering.
If false, all mesh instances in the scene are rendered by the camera, regardless of
visibility. Defaults to false.
 * @property calculateTransform - Custom function you can
provide to calculate the camera transformation matrix manually. Can be used for complex
effects like reflections. Function is called using component's scope.
Arguments:
* {@link Mat4} transformMatrix: output of the function.

provide to calculate the camera projection matrix manually. Can be used for complex
effects like doing oblique projection. Function is called using component's scope.
Arguments:
* {{@link Mat4}} transformMatrix: output of the function
* {number} view: Type of view. Can be {@link VIEW_CENTER}, {@link VIEW_LEFT} or {@link VIEW_RIGHT}.
Left and right are only used in stereo rendering.
 * @property cullFaces - If true the camera will take material.cull into account.
Otherwise both front and back faces will be rendered. Defaults to true.
 * @property flipFaces - If true the camera will invert front and back faces.
Can be useful for reflection rendering. Defaults to false.
 * @property layers - An array of layer IDs ({@link Layer#id}) to which this
camera should belong. Don't push/pop/splice or modify this array, if you want to
change it, set a new one instead. Defaults to [LAYERID_WORLD, LAYERID_DEPTH,
LAYERID_SKYBOX, LAYERID_UI, LAYERID_IMMEDIATE].
 * @property disablePostEffectsLayer - Layer ID of a layer on which the postprocessing of the camera stops being applied to.
Defaults to LAYERID_UI, which causes post processing to not be applied to UI layer and
any following layers for the camera. Set to undefined for post-processing to be applied to all layers of the camera.

/**
 * ElementComponents are used to construct user interfaces. An ElementComponent's [type](#type)
 * property can be configured in 3 main ways: as a text element, as an image element or as a group element.
 * If the ElementComponent has a {@link ScreenComponent} ancestor in the hierarchy, it will be transformed
 * with respect to the coordinate system of the screen. If there is no {@link ScreenComponent} ancestor,
 * the ElementComponent will be transformed like any other entity.
 *
 * You should never need to use the ElementComponent constructor. To add an ElementComponent to a {@link Entity},
 * use {@link Entity#addComponent}:
 *
 * ~~~javascript
 * // Add an element component to an entity with the default options
 * let entity = pc.Entity();
 * entity.addComponent("element"); // This defaults to a 'group' element
 * ~~~
 *
 * To create a simple text-based element:
 *
 * ~~~javascript
 * entity.addComponent("element", {
 *     anchor: new pc.Vec4(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5), // centered anchor
 *     fontAsset: fontAsset,
 *     fontSize: 128,
 *     pivot: new pc.Vec2(0.5, 0.5),            // centered pivot
 *     text: "Hello World!",
 *     type: pc.ELEMENTTYPE_TEXT
 * });
 * ~~~
 *
 * Once the ElementComponent is added to the entity, you can set and get any of its properties:
 *
 * ~~~javascript
 * entity.element.color = pc.Color.RED; // Set the element's color to red
 *
 * console.log(entity.element.color);   // Get the element's color and print it
 * ~~~

 * @property type - The type of the ElementComponent. Can be:
 *
 * * {@link ELEMENTTYPE_GROUP}: The component can be used as a layout mechanism to create groups of ElementComponents e.g. panels.
 * * {@link ELEMENTTYPE_IMAGE}: The component will render an image
 * * {@link ELEMENTTYPE_TEXT}: The component will render text
 * @property screen - The Entity with a {@link ScreenComponent} that this component belongs to. This is automatically set when the component is a child of a ScreenComponent.
 * @property drawOrder - The draw order of the component. A higher value means that the component will be rendered on top of other components.
 * @property anchor - Specifies where the left, bottom, right and top edges of the component are anchored relative to its parent. Each value
 * ranges from 0 to 1. E.g. a value of [0,0,0,0] means that the element will be anchored to the bottom left of its parent. A value of [1, 1, 1, 1] means
 * it will be anchored to the top right. A split anchor is when the left-right or top-bottom pairs of the anchor are not equal. In that case the component will be resized to cover that entire area. E.g. a value of [0,0,1,1] will make the component resize exactly as its parent.
 * @property pivot - The position of the pivot of the component relative to its anchor. Each value ranges from 0 to 1 where [0,0] is the bottom left and [1,1] is the top right.
 * @property margin - The distance from the left, bottom, right and top edges of the anchor. For example if we are using a split anchor like [0,0,1,1] and the margin is [0,0,0,0] then the component will be the same width and height as its parent.
 * @property left - The distance from the left edge of the anchor. Can be used in combination with a split anchor to make the component's left edge always be 'left' units away from the left.
 * @property right - The distance from the right edge of the anchor. Can be used in combination with a split anchor to make the component's right edge always be 'right' units away from the right.
 * @property bottom - The distance from the bottom edge of the anchor. Can be used in combination with a split anchor to make the component's top edge always be 'top' units away from the top.
 * @property top - The distance from the top edge of the anchor. Can be used in combination with a split anchor to make the component's bottom edge always be 'bottom' units away from the bottom.
 * @property width - The width of the element as set in the editor. Note that in some cases this may not reflect the true width at which the element is rendered, such as when the element is under the control of a {@link LayoutGroupComponent}. See `calculatedWidth` in order to ensure you are reading the true width at which the element will be rendered.
 * @property height - The height of the element as set in the editor. Note that in some cases this may not reflect the true height at which the element is rendered, such as when the element is under the control of a {@link LayoutGroupComponent}. See `calculatedHeight` in order to ensure you are reading the true height at which the element will be rendered.
 * @property calculatedWidth - The width at which the element will be rendered. In most cases this will be the same as `width`. However, in some cases the engine may calculate a different width for the element, such as when the element is under the control of a {@link LayoutGroupComponent}. In these scenarios, `calculatedWidth` may be smaller or larger than the width that was set in the editor.
 * @property calculatedHeight - The height at which the element will be rendered. In most cases this will be the same as `height`. However, in some cases the engine may calculate a different height for the element, such as when the element is under the control of a {@link LayoutGroupComponent}. In these scenarios, `calculatedHeight` may be smaller or larger than the height that was set in the editor.
 * @property screenCorners - An array of 4 {@link Vec3}s that represent the bottom left, bottom right, top right and top left corners of the component relative to its parent {@link ScreenComponent}.
 * @property worldCorners - An array of 4 {@link Vec3}s that represent the bottom left, bottom right, top right and top left corners of the component in world space. Only works for 3D ElementComponents.

/**
 * This object allows you to configure and use the transform feedback feature (WebGL2
 * only). How to use:
 *
 * 1. First, check that you're on WebGL2, by looking at the `app.graphicsDevice.webgl2`` value.
 * 2. Define the outputs in your vertex shader. The syntax is `out vec3 out_vertex_position`,
 * note that there must be out_ in the name. You can then simply assign values to these outputs
 * in VS. The order and size of shader outputs must match the output buffer layout.
 * 3. Create the shader using `TransformFeedback.createShader(device, vsCode, yourShaderName)`.
 * 4. Create/acquire the input vertex buffer. Can be any VertexBuffer, either manually created,
 * or from a Mesh.
 * 5. Create the TransformFeedback object: `var tf = new TransformFeedback(inputBuffer)`.
 * This object will internally create an output buffer.
 * 6. Run the shader: `tf.process(shader)`. Shader will take the input buffer, process it and
 * write to the output buffer, then the input/output buffers will be automatically swapped, so
 * you'll immediately see the result.
 * @example
 * // *** shader asset ***
 * attribute vec3 vertex_position;
 * attribute vec3 vertex_normal;
 * attribute vec2 vertex_texCoord0;
 * out vec3 out_vertex_position;
 * out vec3 out_vertex_normal;
 * out vec2 out_vertex_texCoord0;
 * void main(void) {
 *     // read position and normal, write new position (push away)
 *     out_vertex_position = vertex_position + vertex_normal * 0.01;
 *     // pass other attributes unchanged
 *     out_vertex_normal = vertex_normal;
 *     out_vertex_texCoord0 = vertex_texCoord0;
 * }
 * @example
 * // *** script asset ***
 * var TransformExample = pc.createScript('transformExample');
 *
 * // attribute that references shader asset and material
 * TransformExample.attributes.add('shaderCode', { type: 'asset', assetType: 'shader' });
 * TransformExample.attributes.add('material', { type: 'asset', assetType: 'material' });
 *
 * TransformExample.prototype.initialize = function() {
 *     var device = this.app.graphicsDevice;
 *     var mesh = pc.createTorus(device, { tubeRadius: 0.01, ringRadius: 3 });
 *     var node = new pc.GraphNode();
 *     var meshInstance = new pc.MeshInstance(mesh, this.material.resource, node);
 *     var model = new pc.Model();
 *     model.graph = node;
 *     model.meshInstances = [ meshInstance ];
